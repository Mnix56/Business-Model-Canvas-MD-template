# Key Partners

As a start up, we want to collaborate with many different organizations and determine which ones support our business model best. When we become a more matured company, we have a lot to risk. Therefore, we want reliable and long term relationships. Below is a list of companies that we want to establish partnership with:

*Note: the most preferred key partners have check marks in the front of the sentences.*

- [x] ***Airbnb and local hotels:*** Would provides sponsorship opportunities to Hybrid Commute, offers cheaper and better services to our customer, as well as boost our brand awareness.
- [ ] **Local bars, restaurants, and shopping stores:** Would provide destination points for our customers, and give us countless sponsorship opportunities (same as Airbnb and local hotels). 
- [ ] **Local governments:** We rely on local government partnerships in order to continue to operate. Therefore, we need to maintain a healthy relationship with them.
- [ ] **Sporting Goods stores:** Provide transportaion equipment (bikes, scooters, tollerblades, etc.) to our transportation retal feet with special deals and discounts. They also provide useful insights to our rental fleet such as the newest sporting goods, how to use them, and maintenance them.
- [ ] **Local tech start-ups:** Provide exposure (word of mouth) to residents that are most likely to fit into our target demographic.
- [x] ***Paypal and other cashless payment services:*** Would reduce costs and add a measure of autgenticity.
- [ ] **For initial phases:** Universities, airports, big businesses; specifically student organizations
- [x] ***Instacart, Lyft, Uber, Doordash, Postmates, and Grubhub:*** Work together to better each other.

Some of our partners are also our competitors, but they have struggle launching a product, or service, so we partner with them to achieve common revenue.

Companies like Uber and Airbnb are in the same industry with us, but they don't offer the same service with us. So, we can help filling the gap. By joining them in an adventure, it helps us grow customers and increase sales.
